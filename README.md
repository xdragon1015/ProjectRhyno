# ProjectRhyno
A microservice application built in go, and javascript

# What are microservices?
Microservices is the idea of simplying code by splitting you application into different sevices. Each service is given a task or problem and is expected to solve it well. This idea of splitting functionaly into services became popular because of many different reasons. One of these resons was to escape the recurring style of monolothic architecture in applications. In a monolithic application everything is done in one file which overcomplicates things as time passes by. Also, it allows developers to use different programming langauges for each service and have the ability to properly maintain the application as complexsity increases. When the services are well constructed, all the services will communicate to form our full working application.
