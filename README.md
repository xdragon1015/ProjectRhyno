A microservice application built in go, and javascript

# What are microservices?
Microservices is the idea of simplifying the development process by splitting your application into different services. Each service is given a task or problem and is expected to solve it well. This idea of splitting the application into services became popular because of many different reasons. One of these reasons was to escape the recurring style of monolithic architecture in applications. In a monolithic application, everything is done in one file which complicates things overtime. Also, it allows developers to use different programming languages for each service and have the ability to properly maintain the application as complexity increases. When the services are well constructed, all the services will communicate to form our full working application.
